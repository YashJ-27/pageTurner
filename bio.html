                    Mahendra Singh Dhoni is as calm and unruffled a sportsman on the field as he is self-effacing off it.
                    But ‘brute strength’, ‘murderous form’ and ‘a man pos¬sessed’ were some of the phrases that came to mind
                    when, on 5 April 2005 in Visakhapatnam, he exploded onto international consciousness by becoming the
                    first regular Indian keeper to score a one-day century.</p>

                <p>In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic
                    and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of the United States of America-the first
                    African-American to serve in that role-she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in
                    history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and
                    around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives,
                    and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the
                    way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters
                    under an unforgiving media glare.</p>

                    tattoo.
    
                    In this book, Suresh Raina takes us through the challenges he faced as a young cricketer. He was bullied
                    in school and at cricket camps, but he always punched above his weight, overcoming every adversity life
                    threw at him and never giving up. This is the story of the lessons he learnt and the friendships he
                    built.</p>

                    brilliantly re-creates the drama of the experiences that helped shape Nelson Mandela's destiny. Emotive,
                    compelling and uplifting, Long Walk to Freedom is the exhilarating story of an epic life; a story of
                    hardship, resilience and ultimate triumph told with the clarity and eloquence of a born leader.

                    This is the only official book from 1D, charting their journey over the last year and a half, from the
                    places they've visited and fans they've met, to their thoughts and feelings, hopes and dreams, highs and
                    lows. It has been a phenomenal year and this is a phenomenal story. They've won dozens of awards.
                    They've had a bigger US debut than the Beatles. They've played Madison Square Garden, the Royal Variety
                    Show, and sold-out venues across the globe. One Direction, just five young guys from small British
                    towns, has truly gone global.</p>
