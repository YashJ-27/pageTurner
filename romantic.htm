                <p>Agnes Crandall's problems are rolling to a boil. First, a dog-napper invades her kitchen, seriously
                    hampering her attempts to put on a wedding that she's staked her entire net worth on. Then a man climbs
                    through her bedroom window to save her. "Shane" (no last name) may be Agnes's hero, but he's also a
                    professional hitman-so he's no stranger to trouble himself...
    
                    Between a rival who wants to take him out and an uncle who may have lost five million bucks in Agnes's
                    basement, Shane's plate is plenty full. Soon Agnes and Shane are tangled up with the lowlifes after the
                    money, a gang of Southern mob wedding guests, a dog named Rhett, and-most dangerous of all-each other.

                    love-at least not for herself. When she meets wealthy bachelor Joe Travis and mistakes him for a wedding
                    photographer, she has no intention of letting him sweep her off her feet. But Joe is a man who goes
                    after what he wants, and Avery can't resist the temptation of a sexy southern charmer and a hot summer
                    evening.
    
                    After a one night stand, however, Avery is determined to keep it from happening again. A man like Joe
                    can only mean trouble for a woman like her, and she can't afford distractions. She's been hired to plan
                    the wedding of the year-a make-or-break event.</p>
