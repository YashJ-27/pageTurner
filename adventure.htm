                <p>Congo by Michael Crichton is a novel full of adventure. The search for diamonds, a crucial scientific
                    breakthrough and a mythical ruined city set off this adventure into the heart of the Congolese jungle.
                    The American expedition is led by Karen Ross, desperate to find her husband and recover the data he
                    found before he disappeared. But there are other teams trying to get there first, and the way is strewn
                    with life-threatening dangers -- plane crashes, civil wars and a dormant volcano awoken by dormant
                    explosives.</p>

                <p>Originally published in 1902, Heart of Darkness remains one of this century’s most enduring works of
                    fiction. Written several years after Joseph Conrad’s grueling sojourn in the Belgian Congo, the novel is
                    a complex meditation on colonialism, evil, and the thin line between civilization and barbarity. This
                    edition contains selections from Conrad’s Congo Diary of 1890—the first notes, in effect, for the novel,
                    which was composed at the end of that decade.</p>

                    fatal realities. The tale has been retold using simple language and beautiful illustrations to make it
                    easier for the kids to grasp and enjoy. </p>
